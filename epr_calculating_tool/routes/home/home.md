# Welcome to AQUILA EPR fees estimation tool

**Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)** is a policy framework that requires producers to take responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their products, especially the post-consumer stage: collection, recycling, or disposal.

We currently offer estimation tools for you to calculate the amount of financial contribution for EPR regulations.

EPR regulations now covers 6 subjects (with its effective date):

- Rechargeable Batteries: 1/1/2024
- Lubricant: 1/1/2024
- Tires and Tubes: 1/1/2024
- Packaging (Commercial): 1/1/2024
- WEEEs (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment): 1/1/2025
- ELVs (End-of-Life Vehicles): 1/1/2027

## EPR Calculator

CBAM Calulator allows you to estimate your financial contribution based on the volume of products/packaging produced from a specific industry.

Financial contribution (F) = R x V x Fs (unit: VND)
- R: Recycling rate (%)
- V: Volume of products/packaging (kg)
- Fs: the reasonable recycling cost per unit of product or packaging (VND/kg)

With Fs = 1.03 x (T + Cv + Re) 
- T: Transportation cost (VND/kg)
- Cv: Classification and collection cost (VND/kg)
- Re: Recycling cost (VND/kg)
